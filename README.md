# ChatKit

ChatKit is a batteries-included framework for building high-quality, AI-powered chat experiences. It’s designed for developers who want to add advanced conversational intelligence to their apps fast—with minimal setup and no reinventing the wheel. ChatKit delivers a complete, production-ready chat interface out of the box.

**Key features include:**

- **Deep UI customization** so that ChatKit feels like a first-class part of your app
- **Built-in response streaming** for interactive, natural conversations
- **Tool and workflow integration** for visualizing agentic actions and chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Rich interactive widgets** rendered directly inside the chat
- **Attachment handling** with support for file and image uploads
- **Thread and message management** for organizing complex conversations
- **Source annotations and entity tagging** for transparency and references

Simply drop the ChatKit component into your app, configure a few options, and you're good to go.

### What makes ChatKit different?

ChatKit is a framework-agnostic, drop-in chat solution.
You don’t need to build custom UIs, manage low-level chat state, or patch together various features yourself.
Just add the ChatKit component, give it a client token, and customize the chat experience as needed, no extra work needed.
